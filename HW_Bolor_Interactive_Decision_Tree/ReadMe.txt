For this homework I tried my best with the two codes and 
it took me some time to understand them both completely. 
I decided to use the first one we were sent that was a bit 
more complex as I felt that this one afforded better learning. 
I also incorporated a couple of things from the second code 
such as hiding elements. I styled the interactive decision 
tree as per my initial concept (please see the flowchart I 
submitted for Week 1 homework). Perhaps most importantly, I 
wanted to stick to my initial decision tree structure, with 2 
yes or no answers and each answer to each question leading to 
a different question. This was quite hard as the code I 
decided to use implemented a different structure. But after 
some digging, I managed to get all the elements working as per
my initial flowchart/decision tree proposal.
