For this homework, I used the Carbon Intensity API at 
https://carbon-intensity.github.io/api-definitions/?javascript#carbon-intensity-api-v2-0-0 
I experimented with bar chart style visualisation of the different sources of carbon data 
provided by the API. I also experimented with the Chart.js library to try to visualise the 
data as a pie chart. It worked when I put the script in the HTML, but I'm struggling to get 
the code to work from the main.js. I will continue to explore and update the repository if 
any more progress is made over the course of this week.
